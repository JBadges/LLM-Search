# LLM-Search
LLM-Search is a local search tool that indexes and searches text-based files using embeddings generated by open-source Hugging Face embedding models.

## Setup
Create a .env file and set the following parameters
```
DB_PATH=<path to the sqllite db file>
INDEX_DIRECTORIES=<comma seperated list of directories to index>
```
DB_PATH is a file path to where the database will be created, or one that already exists if the program is run already.
### Example
```
DB_PATH=./db.sqlite
INDEX_DIRECTORIES=./notes,./school
```

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JBadges/LLM-Search
cd llm-search
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running
Run `python -m llm_search.app` from within the repo directory

## Backend
This project is designed for small document databases such as school notes or text files. Because of this, the backend uses SQLite and Faiss to handle embedding storage and search. By using small open-source LLMs, all embeddings occur on-device, ensuring privacy while still providing fast performance.

## Supported Operating Systems
This code was only tested on Windows 11, and uses windows specific libraries to check for directory changes.
